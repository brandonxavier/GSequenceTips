These files are simply non-looping versions of the next1 thru next100
emotes.  Looping was removed with the extremely trivial ImageMagick
command:

    convert inputfile.gif -loop 1 outputfile.gif

If anybody knows who the original creator of these emotes is, please
pass it on to me (brandonxavier421@gmail.com) so I may give proper
credit to them.  Thanks!
